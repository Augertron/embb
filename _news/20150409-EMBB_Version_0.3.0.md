We are happy to announce a major update of EMB²: Version 0.3.0 now covers the full [MTAPI standard](http://www.multicore-association.org/workgroup/mtapi.php), which includes basic support for heterogeneous systems. Specialized hardware components such as GPUs or DSPs can be integrated via plugins. Currently, EMB² comes with two ready-to-use plugins, one for OpenCL-capable devices and another one for distributed systems connected via network. Using the built-in load balancer, it is not even necessary to specify where a given set of tasks shall be executed. Besides support for heterogeneous systems, this version also includes a number of [changes and improvements](https://github.com/siemens/embb/blob/v0.3.0/CHANGELOG.md).
