Version 0.4.0 is out! It brings a number of enhancements such as more comfortable interfaces and consistency checks for dataflow networks, task cancellation support and better error checking for the network plugin, and an option that allows the task scheduler to reuse the main thread for improved performance. Also, we resolved a number of mostly minor warnings reported by Grammatech's [CodeSonar](https://www.grammatech.com/products/codesonar) tool and fixed a few bugs. As usual, a complete list of changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/siemens/embb/blob/v0.4.0/CHANGELOG.md).
