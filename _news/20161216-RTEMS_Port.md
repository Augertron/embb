Sebastian Huber from [embedded brains GmbH](http://www.embedded-brains.de/) ported EMB² to [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/), an open source real-time operating system (RTOS) that supports standard APIs such as POSIX. RTEMS is used in space flight, medical devices, networking, etc. and runs on a variety of different processor architectures including ARM, PowerPC, Intel, Blackfin, MIPS, and Microblaze. Thanks a lot for the great work and contributing to EMB²!
