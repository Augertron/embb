Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) require a lot more processing power than traditional automotive applications due to the large amount of sensor data they have to process. In his excellent article "[Specialized compilers address ADAS needs](http://www.edn.com/design/automotive/4457916/Optimizing-compilers-for-ADAS-applications)" on [EDN](http://www.edn.com/), Alexander Herz from [TASKING](http://www.tasking.com/) discusses the challenges in building such systems, from finding a suitable hardware architecture over highly optimized libraries and hardware accelerator support to safety requirements. Regarding parallel programming, which is inevitable for compute-intensive applications, the author states: "Fortunately, libraries like EMBÂ² and LAPACK can be used with relatively little risk, as they were written by experts in this field. As an additional advantage, these libraries ensure a relatively large speed increase due to their parallelism and optimization." Thank you very much!
