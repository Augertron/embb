On August 23, Tobias Sch√ºle presented the results of joint work between 
Prof. Sunita Chandrasekaran (University of Delaware), Prof. Barbara Chapman (University of Houston), and Siemens on "[Exploring Task Parallelism for Heterogeneous Systems Using Multicore Task Management API](https://embb.io/downloads/Exploring%20Task%20Parallelism%20for%20Heterogeneous%20Systems%20Using%20Multicore%20Task%20Management%20API.pdf)" at the [Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for the Many-core Era (ROME)](http://wrome.github.io/grenoble2016/) held in conjunction with [EuroPar 2016](https://europar2016.inria.fr/) in wonderful Grenoble, France. The talk showed that MTAPI is very well-suited as an abstraction layer for heterogeneous systems consisting of classical multicore CPUs as well as accelerators such as GPUs. The [slides](https://wrome.github.io/slides/rome16_schuele.pdf) are now available for download from the website of the workshop.
