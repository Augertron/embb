title: Improved Platform Support using C11/C++11-based Atomic Operations
date: 2017-05-12

EMB² ships with implementations of atomic operations for x86 and ARM processors to be usable with older compilers (supporting C99 / C++03 only). This is important for applications that cannot be migrated easily to more recent language standards. Thanks to Sebastian Huber from [embedded brains GmbH](http://www.embedded-brains.de/), EMB² can now be built using atomic operations provided by C11 / C++11. Just add the option <code>-DUSE_C11_AND_CXX11=ON</code> when generating native build files, e.g. type <code>cmake .. -DUSE_C11_AND_CXX11=ON</code>. This way, EMB² can be used on a variety of platforms besides x86 and ARM such as PowerPC, MIPS, or SPARC. Thanks a lot for the great work and contributing to EMB²!
