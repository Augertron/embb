We are glad to announce a major [release](https://github.com/siemens/embb/releases) of EMB² which is the result of more than two years of development. Since the first open source version, we have worked on a number of features and integrated several improvements:

* Fully compliant MTAPI reference implementation plus C++ wrappers for convenient task management
* Support for heterogeneous systems at all levels (MTAPI and high-level algorithms / patterns)
* Ready-to-use plugins for OpenCL, CUDA, and distributed systems communicating over network
* Various API and build system enhancements for better usability and reduced development effort
* Improved support for timing-critical applications using task priorities and affinities
* Revised and extended documentation including a comprehensive sample application
* Wider platform support and easier portability to other hardware architectures
* Performance and stability improvements (e.g., through static code analysis)

Further information can be found in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/siemens/embb/blob/v1.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).

Feedback and contributions are very welcome!

Your EMB² team
