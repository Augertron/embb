Sebastian Huber from [embedded brains GmbH](http://www.embedded-brains.de/) added multilib support to the EMB² build environment. For example, the following command invoked from the base directory builds and installs EMB² for all multilibs of the <code>arm-rtems4.12</code> GCC cross-compiler installation:

```
./scripts/build_gcc_multilibs.sh arm-rtems4.12
```

Thank you very much for the contribution!
