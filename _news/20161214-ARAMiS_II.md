The research project [ARAMiS II](https://www.aramis2.com/) funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research successfully started on October 1<sup>st</sup>. Within the next three years, the consortium consisting of 33 partners under the lead of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php) will work on development processes, tools, and platforms for the efficient use of multicore architectures. As mentioned in a recent [article on eeNews](http://www.eenewseurope.com/news/better-tools-and-methodologies-multicore-platforms-0), this includes the creation of methods to increase safety, efficiency, and comfort in the deployment of multicore technologies and to make them available at an industrial scale. We are very proud to participate in ARAMiS II and will do our best to integrate the results of our work in the area of runtime platforms in EMBÂ².
