One of the unique features of the [Multicore Task Management API (MTAPI)](http://www.multicore-association.org/workgroup/mtapi.php) is support for heterogeneous hardware architectures, e.g., systems-on-a-chip integrating accelerators like GPUs or DSPs together with a multicore CPU on a single die. The different hardware units, called nodes in MTAPI terminology, need not even have access to shared memory and may transparently communicate via message passing. In a presentation held at the [Embedded Software Engineering Kongress](https://www.ese-kongress.de/), Tobias Sch√ºle explained the key concepts of MTAPI and showed how they help to abstract from the underlying hardware platforms. A summary of these concepts can be found in the [paper](https://embb.io/downloads/EMBB_ESE-Kongress_2015.pdf) (written in German) published in the conference proceedings.
