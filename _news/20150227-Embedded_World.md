The [Embedded World](https://www.embedded-world.de/en) is one of the largest international fairs for embedded systems. This week, Tobias Schüle gave a talk at the associated conference, which is a perfect forum for knowledge transfer spanning the entire spectrum of hardware, software, and tools for the development of embedded systems. The talk gave an introduction to parallel programming on embedded systems and described the main features of MTAPI / EMB² by means of simple examples. The [paper](https://embb.io/downloads/EMBB_Embedded-World_2015.pdf) published as part of the conference proceedings is now available for download.
